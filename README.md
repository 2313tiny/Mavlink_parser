This utility is used for parsing MAVlink version 2 binary files.

1. To build the program, simply run make and press "Enter".
2. You can watch the parsing data from the "mavlink.bin" file.

Minor notes.
After running, you may see the message "*** stack smashing detected ***"
followed by termination. However, the file is read correctly.
